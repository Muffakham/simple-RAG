However, it doesn’t cover certain services, such as routine physical exams, most dental care, and vision care. You have the option to join a separate Medicare drug plan (Part D) for prescription drug coverage.

These plans cover all services that Original Medicare covers, but they may also provide extra benefits, such as vision, dental, and hearing coverage, which Original Medicare does not cover. Unlike Original Medicare, Medicare Advantage plans often require you to use a network of doctors and hospitals and may require referrals for specialist visits. These plans have an annual out-of-pocket spending limit, which can provide financial protection if you have high healthcare costs.

            "\n",
            "### Original Medicare:\n",
            "- **Out-of-Pocket Costs:** There is no yearly limit on out-of-pocket expenses unless you have supplemental coverage such as Medigap, Medicaid, or employer-based plans.\n",
            "- **Supplemental Coverage:** You can purchase a Medigap policy to help cover costs that Original Medicare doesn’t cover, like the 20% coinsurance. Alternatively, coverage from an employer, union, or Medicaid can supplement Original Medicare.\n",
            "- **Medicare Drug Coverage:** Not included; you would typically need to enroll in a separate Part D plan for prescription drug coverage.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Medicare Advantage (MA) Plans:\n",
            "- **Out-of-Pocket Limits:** These plans have a yearly cap on out-of-pocket expenses for covered Part A and Part B services. Once you reach this limit, you pay nothing for covered services for the rest of the year.\n",
            "- **Supplemental Coverage:** You cannot buy Medigap policies to cover out-of-pocket costs in Medicare Advantage plans.\n",
            "- **Integrated Drug Coverage:** Most Medicare Advantage plans include Part D drug coverage, and generally, you cannot join a separate Medicare drug plan.\n",
            "- **Coverage Requirements:** Must cover all services that Original Medicare covers, but may determine which services are medically necessary using their own criteria. They may also offer additional benefits not covered by Original Medicare.\n",
            "- **Prior Authorization:** Many plans require prior authorization for certain services or supplies, meaning you need the plan’s approval before receiving the service in order to have it covered.\n",
            "\n",
            "When choosing between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage, it's important to consider factors like your healthcare needs, budget, and whether you prefer having a limit on out-of-pocket expenses or the flexibility of choosing providers without network restrictions.\n",
